# Future Sales Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains code for predicting future sales based on advertising expenditures in different media channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The prediction is made using a machine learning model trained on a dataset comprising historical data of advertising budgets and corresponding sales.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this prediction task contains the following columns:
- **TV**: Amount of advertising budget spent on television media (in thousands of dollars).
- **Radio**: Amount of advertising budget spent on radio media (in thousands of dollars).
- **Newspaper**: Amount of advertising budget spent in newspapers or print media (in thousands of dollars).
- **Sales**: Product or service sales data (in the same period as advertising expenditure on TV, Radio, and Newspaper).

### Dataset Source
